        <p>I chose to come to Babson College to further my business education. I am from Wenham, MA and want to work on the East Coast after school. I want to graduate with a strong alumni network and Babson has provided those opportunities.</p>

        <p>My favorite sport is lacrosse. I am apart of the Babson College Womens Lacrosse team. My team just won a NEWMAC championship. I enjoy the sport and also the team aspect of it.</p>
