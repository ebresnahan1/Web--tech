        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="images/emily.jpg" alt="emily" title="picture of emily">
            <p> I chose to come to <a href="https://babson.edu">Babson College</a> to further my undergraduate college education. I transfered to Babson to focus on business. I am from the state and intend to work on the East Coast after school in either New York City or Boston. I feel that Babson offers me the ability to build a strong alumni network in the two cities I would like to work in. </p>
        <h2> My Interests</h2>
            <p>My favorite sport is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrosse">lacrosse</a>. I am apart of the Babson College Womens Lacrosse team. My team just won a NEWMAC championship. I enjoy the sport and also the team aspect of it.</p>
